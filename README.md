## Overview

This is a sample Restful API for Shopping Cart developed with Flask related to [labela_backend_assignment](https://github.com/LabelA/labela_backend_assignment).
Following user stories are covered with the app.

* As a company, I want all my products in a database, so I can offer them via our new platform to customers
* As a client, I want to add a product to my shopping cart, so I can order it at a later stage
* As a client, I want to remove a product from my shopping cart, so I can tailor the order to what I actually need
* As a client, I want to order the current contents in my shopping cart, so I can receive the products I need to repair my car
* As a client, I want to select a delivery date and time, so I will be there to receive the order
* As a client, I want to see an overview of all the products, so I can choose which product I want
* As a client, I want to view the details of a product, so I can see if the product satisfies my needs

The app has two services; Product & Cart. 
Product service can create and retrieve products. Cart service can create a cart, add or remove items to cart and checkout.

Postman collection is available [here](./resorces/postman_collection.json).

    * Handle adding same product to cart
    * Handle removing non exist item from cart etc.
  * Better service segregation such as product, cart, order, shipping, inventory.
